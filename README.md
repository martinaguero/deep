# deep
dependencies analysis

This software reads the byte code of a JAR file and calculates a degree of dependency between another JAR.

### version
1.01

### how to use
Run it from command line:
```sh
java -jar deep.jar
```
And the first time it will create a deep.ini (in the same path as the deep.jar) to setup the paths to jars.
