DEEP v1.1 (beta)
Java Dependencies Analysis

This software reads the byte code of a JAR file and calculates a degree of 
dependency between another JAR. It is a measure that can be used as a guide
to determine a level of coupling between two JAR files.

HOW TO USE:

1) Load Source Jar (your software)
2) Load Target Jar (the library)
3) Press Start button

The analysis begins and after a few seconds the calculations will be 
displayed in the Results panel. Also will be available the Dependency Tree.
